# Bag-of-Algorithm
The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval.In this model, a text is represented as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. The bag-of-words model has also been used for computer vision.
<h1>Rasa NLU</h1> internally uses Bag-of-Word (BoW) algorithm to find intent and Conditional Random Field (CRF) to find entities. Although you can use other algorithms for finding intent and entities using Rasa.
